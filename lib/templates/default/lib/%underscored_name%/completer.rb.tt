# Code Explanation.  This is mainly focused on the run method.
#
# There are 3 main branches of logic for completions:
#
#   1. top-level commands - when there are zero completed words
#   2. params completions - when a command has some required params
#   3. options completions - when we have finished auto-completing the top-level command and required params, the rest of the completion words will be options
#
# Terms:
#
#   params - these are params in the command itself. Example: for the method `scale(service, count)` the params would be `service, count`.
#   options - these are cli options flags.  Examples: --noop, --verbose
#
# When we are done processing method params, the completions will be only options. When the detected params size is greater than the arity we are have finished auto-completing the parameters in the method declaration.  For example, say you had a method for a CLI command with the following form:
#
#   scale(service, count) = arity of 2
#
#   <%= project_name %> scale service count [TAB] # there are 3 params including the "scale" command
#
# So the completions will be something like:
#
#   --noop --verbose etc
#
# A note about artity values:
#
# We are using the arity of the command method to determine if we have finish auto-completing the params completions. When the ruby method has a splat param, it's arity will be negative.  Here are some example methods and their arities.
#
#    ship(service) = 1
#    scale(service, count) = 2
#    ships(*services) = -1
#    foo(example, *rest) = -2
#
# Fortunately, negative and positive arity values are processed the same way. So we take simply take the abs of the arity.
#
# To test:
#
#   <%= project_name %> completions
#   <%= project_name %> completions hello
#   <%= project_name %> completions hello name
#   <%= project_name %> completions hello name --
#   <%= project_name %> completions hello name --noop
#
#   <%= project_name %> completions
#   <%= project_name %> completions sub:goodbye
#   <%= project_name %> completions sub:goodbye name
#
# Note when testing, the first top-level word must be an exact match
#
#   <%= project_name %> completions hello # works fine
#   <%= project_name %> completions he # incomplete, this will just break
#
# The completions assumes that the top-level word that is being passed in
# from completor/scripts.sh will always match exactly.  This must be the
# case.  For parameters, the word does not have to match exactly.
#
